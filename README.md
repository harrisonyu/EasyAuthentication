ECE 498 Project Proposal

1.) We decided to go with the gesture based password project. Basically, we would research if we could do 
some hand gestures on a phone that is difficult for someone else to repeat even if they see 
the person entering the hand gesture. This problem is important because currently phones are password protected 
by entering a combination of numbers or drawing some form of line. This is extremely easy to break into if someone 
else sees the combination. So, we want to secure the phone even more so that if someone does see the gesture, 
it would be extremely hard to replicate it.

2.) What makes this problem hard is determining how much error should be allowed in the gesture. 
We don’t want to make our project so sensitive that even the smallest difference wouldn’t allow the user
to access their own phone. We would also have to add that error to how much pressure is put on the phone, 
where the phone gets swiped, and other factors. In addition, we don’t want to allow too much error into the 
gesture so that people could easily replicate it. We have to determine a way to make it easy for the original user 
to be detected, but not someone else trying to break in, even if the other person knows the gesture that is used.




======================

When starting the program for the first time, you will have to put in your gesture based password 5 times for calibration.
When it is finished, the screen will remove the calibration text.
